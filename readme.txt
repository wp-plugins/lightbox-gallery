== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* How can I make regular images appear in a lightbox without [gallery] shortcode?

Just add rel="lightbox" into "a" tag. Here is a sample.

&lt;a href="image.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="this is a caption"&gt;<br />
&lt;img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;

* How can I handle multiple galleries in one page as saparate ones?

You need to do two steps. If you would like to handle galleries separately, 
add different class names into [gallery] and add codes as many as class names 
into `lightbox-gallery.js`.
 

1. Edit `lightbox-gallery.js` and add some codes. Look at the comment of the file.
2. Add a class into [gallery]. ex) [gallery class="gallery2"]

== How to use ==
How to use this plugin is basically the same as the way to add [gallery] which has been adopted 
by over WordPress 2.5. Lightbox Gallery plugin automatically converted the default view of gallery 
into the lightbox view. Photo captions are displayed as tooltips. Photo descriptions are displayed 
when the lightbox pops up.

== Advanced settings ==
There are two additional options to extend the shorttag [gallery].

* lightboxsize

The image size when the lightbox pops up. The default is medium, but you can change to full.

[gallery lightboxsize="full"] 

* meta

Defines whether the exif information is displayed. The default is false.
If you want to show the photo info, set true. The exif shown on the lightbox includes camera body, 
aperture, focal length, shutter speed, and created timestamp.

[gallery meta="true"]

* class

Adds a class attribute of the gallery. The default is 'gallery1'.

[gallery class="gallery2"]

== Uninstall ==

1. Deactivate the plugin
2. That's it! :)
